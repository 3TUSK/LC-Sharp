# Specifications
- `LC3`: The main module representing the LC3 FSM. Functionality is split into smaller modules according to the von Neumann model.
  - `control`: An instance of the Control module
  - `memory`: An instance of the Memory module
  - `processing`: An instance of the Processing module
  - `Fetch()`: Loads the current instruction into IR and increments the PC.
  - `Execute()`: Executes the instruction code stored in IR by setting the control signals in `control`, `memory`, and `processing`.
- `Control`: Contains the PC and IR
  - `lc3`: A reference to the parent.
  - `pc`: A `ushort` for the PC.
  - `ir`: A `ushort` for the IR.
  - `ldPC()`: Sets the `pc` from `pcmuxout` in the parent's `processing`
  - `gatePC()`: Sets the parent's `bus` to the PC
  - `ldIR()`: Sets the `ir` from the parent's `bus`
- `Memory`: Contains the data of the LC-3's main memory
  - `mar`: A `ushort` for the MAR.
  - `mdr`: A `ushort` for the MDR.
  - `mem`: A `Dictionary<ushort, ushort>` that maps addresses to data.
  - `ldMAR()`: Sets `mar` to the `bus`.
  - `ldMDR()`: Sets `mdr` to the `bus`.
  - `gateMAR()`: Sets the `bus` to `mar`.
  - `gateMDR()`: Sets the `bus` to `mdr`.
  - `memEnR()`: Writes the data of `mem` at the address in `mar` to `mdr`.
  - `memEnW()`: Writes the data of `mdr` to `mem` at the address in `mar`
  - `Read(ushort mar)`: Used by the handler to directly read from memory
  - `Write(ushort mar, ushort mdr)`: Used by the handler to directly write to memory
- `Assembler`: Current implementation of the LC-3 assembler. Converts assembly string code to shortcode

# Process
- The `LC3` stores all data in the form of `short` integers, or "shortcode."
- The `Assembler` first converts all the string code into "shortcode" and then writes it into the `LC3`'s memory.
