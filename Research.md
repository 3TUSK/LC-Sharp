# Research
We researched existing LC-3 programs through GitHub to determine a base for our own work.

- LC-3 VM
  - This is a detailed explanation of a minimal LC-3 emulator written in 250 lines of C. It links to two LC-3 demo games.
- https://github.com/zzh1996/lc3asm/blob/master/lc3asm.cpp#L63
  - A very simple C++ assembler that parses with regex and implements instructions through the god-class antipattern
- https://github.com/edga/lc3
  - An advanced LC-3 toolset that includes a tiny operating system with functioning interrupts.
